              Our BCI wearables are so minimalistic and affordable that we can't
              just purchase off-the-shelf hardware, we have to make it
              ourselves. As a Hardware Engineer, you design and build
              next-generation consumer hardware products.. You develop from the
              lowest levels of circuit design to large system design and see
              those systems all the way through to high volume manufacturing.
              Your primary focus will be to design, develop and deploy the
              electrical architecture and the schematics for the end product. We
              need you to be versatile, display leadership qualities and be
              enthusiastic to take on new problems as we continue to push
              technology forward
